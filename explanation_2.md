This is used to find files within the operating system (os). This involves the use of the "import os" to enable us to be able to traverse a folder down to the file we are looking for.
A recursive data structure is used because the nature of finding files requires travesing the folders down to the required file.
The time complexity is Linear O(n) because of the Single for loop in the "find_files(suffix, path)" function. This means the algorithm increases or decreases with the number of inputs.
