A blockchain is a sequential chain of records that contains blocks that contain information and cryptographic hash of the previous block
A linkedlist is the data structure used for block chain because it is similar to a linked list.

Time complexity Analysis:

The blockchain problem has a double linkedlist which has a time complexity of O(n) in its worst case scenerio.
It also has the time complexity to search by the hash function is O(1)
Therefore, the time complexity of the blockchain is O(n)

Space complexity Analysis:

The space complexity is Linear O(n) because of the Doubly linkedlist usedfor the block chain problem. Also the space complexity is linear because the more the nodes of each block of the chain the more the space it is required in memory. As a result, the space complexity is O(n)
